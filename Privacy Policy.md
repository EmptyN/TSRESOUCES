# 0 General Information,
"Tsauno" always refers to the Discord application (bot) and the associated service provider (development team).

# 1 Data Acquired,

### 1.1 Discord identifiers and profile details:
- User ID, Username, Discriminator, Display name / nickname, Avatar (URL).  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Legitimate interest — required so the bot can identify, display and address users correctly when operating in servers.)
- Guild (server) ID, Channel ID, Role ID, Message ID.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Legitimate interest — required to route actions, manage permissions and operate server features such as tickets and notifications.)

### 1.2 Ticket system metadata (opt‑in, per server):
- Ticket channel ID, ticket owner user ID, ticket creation and closure timestamps, moderator/closer user ID, ticket status flags.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Consent / Contract performance — the ticket feature is enabled by server administrators; this metadata is necessary to create, manage and close tickets and to provide the ticket feature.)

### 1.3 Notify / tracking entries (opt‑in, per server):
- Tracked item identifiers supplied by admins (e.g., platform username or link), target channel ID, optional role ID to ping, and the guild ID where the tracking is configured.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Consent — administrators explicitly add these entries to opt a guild into external notifications.)

### 1.4 Leveling data:
- User ID and minimal progress/state required to show ranks, leaderboards and assign configured reward roles in guilds where leveling is enabled. Display names or guild nicknames may be read from Discord to present in embeds.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Legitimate interest / Contract performance — the data is required for the leveling features to function and to deliver the requested experience.)

### 1.5 Message content for transcripts (server‑controlled):
- Message content and attachments are processed only when a server admin explicitly requests a transcript or configures the bot to post transcripts into a guild channel; transcripts are then posted to that server channel. The bot does not proactively collect or retain chat transcripts for other purposes.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Consent / Local control — transcripts are produced and stored (if any) under the control of the server staff who opt to enable the transcript target.)

### 1.6 Minimal operational logs (diagnostics):
- Minimal technical logs that may include timestamps, error messages and identifiers (user/guild/message IDs) needed to diagnose problems or investigate abuse. Personal data in logs is limited to identifiers required for troubleshooting.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Legitimate interest — necessary to maintain, secure and debug the service.)

### 1.7 Personal data via explicit opt‑in (OAuth or similar):
- Email address or other profile data only if a user explicitly  or equivalent and consents to share that information.  
  (Reason / lawful basis: Consent — only collected when the user explicitly authorizes it.)connects their Discord account via an opt‑in OAuth flow

# 2 Data Use,
All acquired data is used to provide and operate the bot features described (tickets, notifications, leveling, configuration and administrative tools). Data is also used to improve service reliability, diagnose issues and prevent abuse. Uses are limited to the purposes listed above and as configured by server administrators.

# 3 Data Stored,

### 3.1 Discord identifiers and profile details:
- Persisted: Guild IDs, channel IDs, role IDs, message IDs and user IDs that are required to map configuration and features (for example: which channel a panel is posted in, which role is a support role, which message is the panel).  
  (Storage reason: Legitimate interest / Contract performance — these identifiers must be kept so configured features continue to function.)
- Transient: Display names, avatars and other profile fields read from Discord are used when presenting information (embeds, replies) but are not persistently stored by default beyond what is required for configured features.

### 3.2 Ticket system metadata:
- Persisted: Ticket metadata such as ticket channel ID, owner ID, creation/closure timestamps and the moderator ID are stored where the ticket system is enabled. This metadata supports ticket lifecycle management and auditability within the server.  
  (Storage reason: Consent / Contract performance — required to operate the opt‑in ticket feature.)
- Important: Full message transcripts are not automatically stored off‑server by the bot. If a server admin configures a transcript target channel, the transcript is posted into that server channel (under the control of server staff). Users who require access to transcripts should contact the relevant server staff — the bot operator does not centrally archive transcripts unless explicitly configured by the server.

### 3.3 Notify / tracking entries:
- Persisted: Entries added by server administrators (tracked identifiers/links, target channel IDs and optional ping roles) are stored so the bot can continue to post notifications as configured.  
  (Storage reason: Consent — administrators explicitly opt in by adding these entries.)

### 3.4 Leveling data:
- Persisted: Minimal rows linking a user ID to their progress/state in guilds that have leveling enabled (used to compute ranks, leaderboards and role assignment).  
  (Storage reason: Legitimate interest / Contract performance — required to deliver the leveling feature.)
- These records are retained until requested to be Removed.

### 3.5 Operational logs:
- Persisted: Short‑lived diagnostic logs (errors, stack traces, limited identifiers) may be kept for debugging and abuse prevention. These logs are restricted and used only for operational purposes.  
  (Storage reason: Legitimate interest — to ensure service stability and security.)

### 3.6 International storage and transfers:
- Data may be processed or stored in jurisdictions including Germany and the Netherlands and may be transmitted internationally for operational reasons (hosting, APIs). Appropriate safeguards such as TLS for transport and standard contractual protections (where applicable) are used. While reasonable protections are applied, there is no absolute guarantee against all risks.

# 4 Security of Data,
The security of your data is important. No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We use commercially reasonable measures to protect personal data and access is limited to what is necessary to operate and maintain the service.

# 5 Disclosure of Data,
We will only disclose data when legally required or to protect legal rights and safety. Stored data may be disclosed:
#### To comply with a legal obligation.
#### To protect against legal liability.
#### To protect and defend our services.
#### To prevent or investigate wrongdoing in connection with the service.
#### To protect the personal safety of users of the service or the public.

# 6 Data Control,
### I have concerns with the service.
We will try to resolve any data processing or security concerns. Please contact us via the [Support Server Tsauno Community](https://discord.gg/GsDXseZpxf).

### How do I request my data (copy) / have it removed?
You have the right to request your data or have it removed. Please join the [Support Server Tsauno Community](https://discord.gg/GsDXseZpxf) to get support contact — external channels are not supported for identity verification.  
#### We will handle your request within 30 days of it being logged.

### Right to Rectification  
Because account and server data are linked to Discord, corrections to Discord account fields must be made through Discord itself. Once updated in Discord, the service will reflect those changes automatically. This ensures only verified account owners can modify their data and prevents fraudulent requests.

#### By Using Tsauno (or Being part of a Discord Server Using Tsauno) you agree to This Privacy Policy and The Terms of Service and have no Excuse of not being Informed.
Any updates to the Privacy Policy will be announced on the [Tsauno Community](https://discord.gg/GsDXseZpxf) server.
